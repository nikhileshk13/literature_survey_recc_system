To make such systems robust, multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.</td>\n",

This fact has complex consequences on data analysis algorithms that motivate modifications of them. In fact most of the traditional data analysis tools for regression, classification and clustering have been adapted to functional inputs under the general name of functional Data Analysis (FDA). In this paper, we investigate the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for functional data analysis and we focus on the problem of curves discrimination. SVMs are large margin classifier tools based on implicit non linear mappings of the considered data into high dimensional spaces thanks to kernels. We show how to define simple kernels that take into account the unctional nature of the data and lead to consistent classification. Experiments conducted on real world data emphasize the benefit of taking into account some functional aspects of the problems.</td>\n",

Our experiments show that the more parameters considered, the accuracy doesn't always increase, and only when appropriate parameters chosen, the accuracy can improve. Moreover for different approaches, the best input pattern is different. With different parameters as input, the optimal bandwidth is dissimilar for KR. The rms errors of photometric redshifts based on SVM and KR methods are less than 0.03 and 0.02, respectively. Finally the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches are summarized. Compared to other methods of estimating photometric redshifts, they show their superiorities, especially KR, in terms of accuracy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states. Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is `barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.</td>\n",

To make such systems robust, multiclass neuralnetwork classifiers capable of learning from noisy data have been suggested. However on large face data sets such systems cannot provide the robustness at a high level. In this paper we explore a pairwise neural-network system as an alternative approach to improving the robustness of face recognition. In our experiments this approach is shown to outperform the multiclass neural-network system in terms of the predictive accuracy on the face images corrupted by noise.    \n",

Rather than relying on projection on a truncated Hilbert basis as in our previous work, we use an implicit spline interpolation that allows us to compute SVM on the derivatives of the studied functions. To that end, we propose a kernel defined directly on the discretizations of the observed functions. We show that this method is universally consistent.    \n",

This fact has complex consequences on data analysis algorithms that motivate modifications of them. In fact most of the traditional data analysis tools for regression, classification and clustering have been adapted to functional inputs under the general name of functional Data Analysis (FDA). In this paper, we investigate the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for functional data analysis and we focus on the problem of curves discrimination. SVMs are large margin classifier tools based on implicit non linear mappings of the considered data into high dimensional spaces thanks to kernels. We show how to define simple kernels that take into account the unctional nature of the data and lead to consistent classification. Experiments conducted on real world data emphasize the benefit of taking into account some functional aspects of the problems.    \n",

We probe the performances of SVMs and KR for different input patterns. Our experiments show that the more parameters considered, the accuracy doesn't always increase, and only when appropriate parameters chosen, the accuracy can improve. Moreover for different approaches, the best input pattern is different. With different parameters as input, the optimal bandwidth is dissimilar for KR. The rms errors of photometric redshifts based on SVM and KR methods are less than 0.03 and 0.02, respectively. Finally the strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches are summarized. Compared to other methods of estimating photometric redshifts, they show their superiorities, especially KR, in terms of accuracy.    \n",

       "109    Recent experimental studies indicate that synaptic changes induced by neuronal activity are discrete jumps between a small number of stable states. Learning in systems with discrete synapses is known to be a computationally hard problem. Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning algorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it performs remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite number of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random classification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations close to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This is to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve efficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse. Furthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden states which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to the standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for synaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is `barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only (change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the synapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible states and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K visible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily implemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.    \n",

The distribution of counted tunneling events is measured as a function of gate and source-drain-voltage for several consecutive electron numbers on the quantum dot. For certain configurations we observe super-Poissonian statistics for bias voltages at which excited states become accessible. The associated counting distributions interestingly show a bimodal characteristic. Analyzing the time dependence of the number of electron counts we relate this to a slow switching between different electron configurations on the quantum dot.    \n",

Our main result shows, for example, that support vector machines (SVMs) using Gaussian RBF kernels can learn the best forecaster from a sequence of noisy observations if (a) the unknown observational noise process is bounded and has a summable Œ±-mixing rate and (b) the unknown ergodic dynamical system is defined by a Lipschitz continuous function on some compact subset of ‚Ñù^d and has a summable decay of correlations for Lipschitz continuous functions. In order to prove this result we first establish a general consistency result for SVMs and all stochastic processes that satisfy a mixing notion that is substantially weaker than Œ±-mixing.    \n",
